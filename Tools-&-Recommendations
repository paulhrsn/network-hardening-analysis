# Hardening tools recommended:
- Implement multi-factor authentication. 
- Set & Enforce strict password policies
- Implement regular firewall maintenance, updating security configurations to stay ahead of threatas.

# Explanation of recommendations:

Enforcing MFA adds additional layers of security beyond the password that will help prevent/contain future breaches
or access the network through a brute force attack. A strict password policy within the company would make it much more challenging
for malicious agents to access the network. Some extra password-related security layers could be increasing the required password complexity,
locking an IP address out of the login screen if there have been enough failed attempts, not allowing password to be reused, and more. Finally,
regular firewall maintenace is a minimum. They have to always embody up-to-date standards, be able to accurately deny traffic, and report traffic where relevant.
